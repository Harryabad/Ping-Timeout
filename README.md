# Ping-Timout
# Ping-Timeout Logs when 'Request times out' occur.

Using pip install pythonping
      pip install socket  
      
I made this program to log when ping time out requests were occuring. My work was experience network issues in which we were have internet usage drops, wired and wifi. This was used to see if there was a common theme, such as time throughout the day. As well as keeping a log to send to our third party provider.  We we're not always in the office during this time to check 'ping -t www.google.com/' hence recording  the timeouts into a txt.   The Ping Timeouts.txt is an example of successful requests, not timeout recorded at this time.
